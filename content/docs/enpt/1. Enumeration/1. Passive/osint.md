Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the process of gathering and analysing available information to assess threats, make decisions, or answer specific questions.

The use of OSINT in this example is to enumerate the organisationâ€™s external attack surface through passive techniques.

Passive techniques aim to replicate genuine activity and should appear as benign upon any investigation.
