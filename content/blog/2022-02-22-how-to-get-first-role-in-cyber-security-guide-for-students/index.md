## Background
During 2021 and 2022, I provided free support, mentorship and career counselling to over 100 individuals wishing to break into the cyber security industry in Australia. Despite mainstream media, boot camps and universities regularly broadcasting that there is a cyber security skills shortage, and that you can become a professional in "just 24 weeks", it hasn't been made clear that the shortage is of experienced professionals, and not entry level candidates. 

In history, cyber security was not a domain of knowledge that could just be studied as a bachelors degree and broken into immediately. It was typically a speciality that professionals would end up in after extensive experience in an operational or information technology roles. In the present day, students are completing bachelors degrees, and attending boot camp courses with the expectations that finding a role will be simple and easy. This is just simply not the case, and has resulted in many students still struggling to find a role in the industry, even 2 years after they have finished their studies.

There are an abundance of cyber security graduates applying for a small amount of entry level roles every year, and standing out in the crowd can be difficult. This article aims to address the most common question I am asked, "How do I find my first role in Cyber Security?", with recommendations provided based on my own, and my colleagues perspectives. The expectation is not that all of the techniques discussed below are required to be implemented, but selecting a few will prove useful. They are not ordered for any particular reason.

## Recommendations
### #1 - Subscribe to and regularly review the latest cyber security news.
As technology is always changing, it's necessary to keep up with cyber security legislation (e.g., the new critical infrastructure bill), vulnerabilities (e.g., log4j), breaches (e.g., the colonial pipeline attack) and threat groups (e.g., Lazarus). You don't have to know everything, but you should be able to converse freely with potential employers about these topics. You can bookmark some of the following sites to review regularly:
* [IT News Australia](https://www.itnews.com.au/)
* [The Hackers News](https://thehackernews.com/)
* [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)
* [This Week In 4n6](https://thisweekin4n6.com/)
* [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/)

### #2 - Build a home research Windows Active Directory lab.
You must be knowledgeable with Windows Active Directory environments in order to become an information security professional. A virtual home lab can be constructed on your desktop PC without the need for various physical components. This lab will be where you may put your skills to the test, as well as quickly create and deconstruct virtual infrastructure, and essentially act as your playground for testing and learning. 

In addition to setting up this lab, you should consider writing a one-page document about the architecture of the environment, which you could include on your resume as a personal project. By creating this home lab, you are proving to prospective employers that you are familiar with the environments that modern organisations use to support their business processes. It also demonstrates that you have hands on, real-world experience with Windows Active Directory, rather than just conceptual knowledge based on your studies.
