## Background
During 2021 and 2022, I provided free support, mentorship and career counselling to over 100 individuals wishing to break into the cyber security industry in Australia. Despite mainstream media, boot camps and universities regularly broadcasting that there is a cyber security skills shortage, and that you can become a professional in "just 24 weeks", it hasn't been made clear that the shortage is of experienced professionals, and not entry level candidates. 

In history, cyber security was not a domain of knowledge that could just be studied as a bachelors degree and broken into immediately. It was typically a speciality that professionals would end up in after extensive experience in an operational or information technology roles. In the present day, students are completing bachelors degrees, and attending boot camp courses with the expectations that finding a role will be simple and easy. This is just simply not the case, and has resulted in many students still struggling to find a role in the industry, even 2 years after they have finished their studies.

There are an abundance of cyber security graduates applying for a small amount of entry level roles every year, and standing out in the crowd can be difficult. This article aims to address the most common question I am asked, "How do I find my first role in Cyber Security?", with recommendations provided based on my own, and my colleagues perspectives. The expectation is not that all of the techniques discussed below are required to be implemented, but selecting a few will prove useful. They are not ordered for any particular reason.
