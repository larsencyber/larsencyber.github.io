## Background
The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is often seen as the "holy grail" of penetration testing certifications in the cyber security industry. This is because, unlike many other industry certifications, your technical skills are put to the test in a grueling 24 hour exam where you are required to exploit an Active Directory environment, and a combination of additional 3 standalone Linux or Windows machines.

However, after studying the PEN-200 course and completing the exam in July 2023, I believe it is not as difficult as the industry makes it out to be. There is a significant amount of knowledge that is required to be understood and applied, however the depth of expertise required is really only at the beginner to intermediate level. As such, I think anyone even considering completing the course, should just throw themselves in the deep end and give it a red hot go. 

Often the barrier to entry with the PEN-200 course and the OSCP exam is not just the time investment required, but the actual financial investment as well. It is well worth it, however paying upfront $1500 USD for 90 day lab access or $2500 USD for 365 days lab access, and then including GST in Australia is a hefty $2450 AUD and $4100 AUD respectively. This begs the question of what preparation can you complete before signing up to the course? This article aims to answer this question and provide guidance. 

## Overview
I think the following 5 critical concepts must not only be understood, but also have been practiced in order to successfully pass the OSCP exam. In the next sections, I will go through each of these concepts and suggest high quality and affordable training options. Most training options overlap with each of the categories below.
1. Fundamental IT & Security Knowledge
2. Basic Network & Web Attacks
3. Active Directory Enumeration, Attacks & Lateral Movement 
4. Windows Privilege Escalation
5. Linux Privilege Escalation

## Summary (TL;DR)
1. If you are a complete beginner, sign up to the [eJPT](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/), $299 USD once-off. 
2. Sign up to [HackTheBox VIP](https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/pricing) for lab machine access, $14 USD monthly.
3. Sign up to the [TCM Security Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/), $30 USD monthly.
4. Sign up to [Tib3rius Windows & Linux Priv Esc](https://www.udemy.com/user/tib3rius/) courses, $35 USD once-off.
5. Get support from an [OSCP mentor](https://www.oscpmentor.com/), $25 USD per hour.

## Complete Beginners (eJPT)
This section applies to complete beginners, those who have no experience using Linux, and those who only have a conceptual understanding of how networking and operating systems work. This section can be skipped by those who feel confident in their ability to work in a command line interface and use tools. 

I recommend checking out the [eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/). Access to the course content is available in the Fundamentals Monthly subscription at $39 USD ($60 AUD) per month. Or alternatively you can sign up for 1 year of course access which includes an eJPT exam attempt voucher for $299 USD ($450 AUD). 

This is a great entry level course which covers not only beginner penetration testing skills, but also important fundamental concepts such as:
* The information security industry
* Cryptography and VPNs
* Binary arithmetic basics
* Protocols and routing
* TCP and UDP
* Firewalls and network defence
* DNS
* Programming and command line scripting

The course also covers the basics of the following:
* Information gathering
* Footprinting & scanning
* Vulnerability assessments
* Web attacks
* System attacks
* Network attacks

I personally completed the eJPT 3 years ago when I was still a beginner in the cyber security industry and found it very valuable. However, I don't think it's required to progress to the next stage of learning, so if you are on a fast tracked timeline, get started on the next stage straight away.

## Starting Point - TCM Security Academy
I highly recommend [The Cyber Mentor (TCM) Security Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/). They have a variety of courses on their academy website which costs $30 USD per month for unlimited access. You can also get access to portions of their course content for free on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy/videos). Their courses reference labs from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/hacker/pricing), so you may require a premium subscription on those sites to practice hands-on skills.
