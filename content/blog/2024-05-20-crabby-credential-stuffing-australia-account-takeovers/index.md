# Abstract
In January 2024, breaking headlines were made by national Australian news agencies that 50+ major Australian brands such as Officeworks, The Iconic, and Dan Murphy's had customer accounts compromised through credential stuffing attacks. Victim customers reported stolen funds and credit card fraud.

This research concluded that compromised Australian accounts were first advertised for sale in July 2023 using public Telegram channels by a threat actor called "Based". Account sales were transacted on Discord, and two websites, before the cyber-crime business was acquired in November 2023 by an infamous international account vendor called "Juicy". This vendor rapidly rose to popularity in past year by acquiring many other well-known account shops. The Australian account shop was rebranded as "Crabby" and has utilised three websites and multiple Telegram channels to sell compromised AU accounts, which has continued to this day.

Low-level fraudsters purchasing the stolen accounts were observed to demonstrate poor operational security, often oversharing information related to their identities and the crimes they were committing. This included order reference numbers, recorded videos, and plans to collect fraudulently purchased goods including the time and store location. Whilst they are motivated by financial gain, it is clear they are also driven by the excitement and challenge of engaging in illicit activities, and would take risks in pursuit of their goals. 

This scenario prevents a challenge for law enforcement who wish to disrupt this activity, due to compromised account vendors operating out of foreign jurisdictions. The key to disrupting the rise of this crime lies in targeting the demand side of the equation. By focusing on catching and prosecuting the low-level fraudsters in Australia who are buying the compromised accounts, law enforcement can set a precedent and deter others from engaging in similar activities.
