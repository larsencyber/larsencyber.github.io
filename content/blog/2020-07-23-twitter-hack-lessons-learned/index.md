## 1. Summary of Events
On Wednesday 15th July 2020, 45 of 130 targeted Twitter accounts belonging to the world's most recognisable figures were compromised. Accounts included investment mogul Warren Buffet, business magnate Bill Gates, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, presidential candidate Joe Biden, presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg and ex-president Barrack Obamap[1].

The accounts had been identified as compromised after they began posting statements about a bitcoin scam giveaway called "CryptoForHealth", which enticed victims into sending their own bitcoin to the perpetrator's wallet, under the impression they would receive double of what they had sent in return[2]. At present time, the bitcoin wallet has received over 400 transactions accumulating almost 13 stolen bitcoin, worth approximately USD $118,000[3]. However, the true count of victims and scammed bitcoin could have been much higher as various cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets indicated that they had blocked thousands of withdrawals to the perpetrator's wallet[4].
